Let me be very clear here, this is my theme, i know im going to sound like an asshole saying this but its mine, not yours, i will not be taking requests to add or remove css, if its a critical issue make a thread and I might look at it but i dont see how css would have something that critical, if you find something you think i might enjoy then go ahead and make a pull request and i'll probably look at it, im going to keep adding onto this for weeks, maybe months, maybe even years and the code is not supposed to be pretty, it starts with a basic customized clearvision from https://www.bdeditor.dev/ and then i started adding snippets from multiple places, mainly the blackbox, clearvision, vencord, and CreArts discord servers (links at the bottom), and another thing, this is meant for vencord, not betterdiscord, not powercord, while i would like for it to to work with all those other client mods it is made for vencord, and it uses css that edits plugins for vencord, and i am only concerned about it working for vencord, now with that out of the way

# Installation
Better Discord (not supported, and not tested, however a good chunk of the code should still work fine):
Download the Stellesvision.theme.css file into your %appdata%\Betterdiscord\Themes folder, it should now just show up as a normal theme in betterdiscord

Powercord:
...
I've got no idea mate, I looked at one video about Powercord and if you can understand all that you can probably figure out how to install it, it should install just like any other theme so good luck I guess

Vencord:
either paste the link to the raw file (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stelle-Valentine/Stellevision/main/Stellesvision.theme.css) into your theme's menu, or copy the content of the Stellesvision.theme.css file into your quickcss 

# Plugin Changes (that I remember)
Platform Indicators - Less intrusive icons

Spotify Controls - Comfywave v2 from the Vencord discord (slightly modified to not change the color of the status icons)

Show Hidden Channels - Makes the Lock on hidden channels jangle when you click on the channel

# Everything else
This will not be updated in real-time, even as I'm writing this I've already added a few more snippets to it and it would be unreasonable to keep it constantly up to date, I might not even update it at all, if you look at everything else I've made you can see it's not maintained, and it's not because I don't care about it, well actually that is the reason, I mean I care about it but I lose interest in everything remarkably fast and it's just too much commitment to constantly maintain it.
